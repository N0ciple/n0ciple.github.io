I recently defended my PhD at **Sorbonne Université** 👨‍🎓, where I specialised in **deep neural network compression**, pruning, and sparsity. 

My journey has taken me from developing predictive maintenance models at **Air France** ✈️ to researching state-of-the-art pruning techniques ✂️ at **Netatmo**.

Outside of work, I am passionate about **DIY** and **tinkering** and on my spare time I try to make my home **smarter** 🧠.
