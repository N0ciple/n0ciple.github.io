## About Ethereum and Ethereum mining

**Ethereum** is the second most popular cryptocurrency by volume on the internet. One nice thing about it is that it has been conceived to be **ASICs-proof**. You can _in theory_, only mine ETH on a GPU or CPU. It is to say that you could help secure the blockchain and more importantly **earn a bit of ETH** from your computer. No need for an expensive and **noisy ASIC miner** !

If you want to mine cryptocurrency easily, you can use premade binaries (such as [T-Rex miner](https://trex-miner.com/)) or services (such as [NiceHash](https://www.nicehash.com/)). However, bear in mind that most of these binaries or services take **a small fee**, generally around **1%** of your hard-earned ETH. If you would rather keep this 1% for you or use **open-source software**, this is possible thanks to [ethminer](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer)!

Ethminer is an open-source Ethereum miner written in C++ and compatible with both AMD (through OpenCL) and Nvidia (through CUDA) GPUs. The latest release of ethminer is from **july 2019**, and is built against CUDA 9 at best. With **CUDA 9** you **will not** be able to run ethminer on the **most recent Nvidia cards** (RTX 3000 series, for example, requires at least CUDA 11.1). Therefore you will need to **build ethminer yourself** if you want to use recent GPUs. This is far from impossible but a bit tedious since ethminer uses Hunter to fetch some dependencies. Hunter uses Bintray, which has been [sunseted](https://jfrog.com/blog/into-the-sunset-bintray-jcenter-gocenter-and-chartcenter/) on the 1rst of May 2021.

To keep this simple, the easiest way to use ethminer is to use a **docker container** that does all the hard work of building and running ethminer for you. If you just want to use the Docker image directly, jump to the [section](#running) about actually running ethminer. If you want some details about how to make the **Dockerfile** follow through the next section!

## Requirements

For this project you will need to have :
- A Linux machine with at least one Nvidia GPU.
- Docker. It can be installed on linux with `curl https://get.docker.com | sh`
- nvidia-docker. It can be installed on Debian based version of Linux with `sudo apt install nvidia-docker2`
- The Nvidia drivers. It can be installed on Ubuntu with `sudo apt install nvidia-headless-470-server` if it was not already installed.

## Creating the Dockerfile

First, let us create a directory to work in, I will call it `ethminer-docker`. In our folder, we will first create a script to launch ethminer. Create a file `mining.sh` and write the following script:

```bash
ethminer --HWMON 2 \  
         -P $MINING_ADDRESS \ 
         --api-bind 0.0.0.0:3333
```
`--HWMON 2` Enable hardware monitoring \
`-P $MINING_ADDRESS` Uses an environment variable to store the pool address + wallet \
`--api-bind 0.0.0.0:3333` Enable the API on port 3333. There is no need to change the port, since we can expose a different port to the host with Docker.

Your folder structure should now look like this:
```
ethminer-docker
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mining.sh
```

Now, in order to build our Docker container, we are going to write a file called `Dockerfile`. This file will contain all the instruction to create the docker image. The original instructions specific to ethminer can be found on the [`docs/BUILD.md`](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer/blob/master/docs/BUILD.md) file of the ethermine repo.

In our Dockerfile, we first start by writing the following line that allows us to use a **premade image from Nvidia** containing the drivers as a **base image**, on top of which we will install the drivers. As you can see here, our docker image will have the driver version `460.73.01`.

```Dockerfile
FROM nvidia/driver:460.73.01-ubuntu20.04
```
Then we update the sources and install the necessary dependencies to build ethminer.\
The environment variable `DEBIAN_FRONTEND` is here to prevent `apt-get` from asking us questions since the installation process is supposed to be **unattended**. That is also why we add `-y` : to accept without further input from `apt-get`
```Dockerfile
RUN apt-get update && \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install kmod git cmake perl gcc g++ wget --no-install-recommends -yq
```

We fetch the CUDA install script, run it and finaly delete it in the same `RUN` statement. This prevents the addition of a lot of useless layer in the creation of the docker image. Here we download CUDA version `11.4.2`
```Dockerfile
RUN wget --no-check-certificate https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/11.4.2/local_installers/cuda_11.4.2_470.57.02_linux.run && \
    sh cuda_11.4.2_470.57.02_linux.run --silent --toolkit --no-man-page --no-opengl-libs && \
    rm cuda_11.4.2_470.57.02_linux.run 
```
We change our working directory to `/`.
```Dockerfile
WORKDIR "/"
```

This big one-liner is responsible for cloning, configuring, building ethminer and finaly removing the useless files. This command is quite a big chunk so I will explained it in details. I used a big one-liner once again to **limit the number of layers generated**.
```Dockerfile
RUN git clone https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git -o ethminer && \
    cd /ethminer && \
    git submodule update --init --recursive && \
    mkdir build && cd build && \
    # Hack because bintray does not exists anymore
    # see https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/652841/boost-continually-fails-to-download-while-using-cmake-for-ethminer
    sed -i '/hunter_config(Boost VERSION 1.66.0)/c\hunter_config(\n     Boost\n     VERSION 1.66.0_new_url\n     SHA1 f0b20d2d9f64041e8e7450600de0267244649766\n     URL https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.66.0/source/boost_1_66_0.tar.gz\ )' /ethminer/cmake/Hunter/config.cmake && \
    cmake .. -DETHASHCL=OFF -DAPICORE=ON -DETHASHCUDA=ON -DBINKERN=OFF && \
    cmake --build . && \
    make install && \
    cd / && rm -rf ethminer
```
In this command, we first clone the repo on a folder called `ethminer`. We then basically follow the building instruction from the ethminer repo. But before the configuring, we use a big `sed` command to edit the **Hunter configuration**. This is necessary since without this modification, Hunter is going to try to fetch Boost on Bintray and **fail**. Downloading manually Boost is not going to work either. The **hash does not correspond** to the one expected by Hunter, hence this modification with `sed`. More details [here](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/652841/boost-continually-fails-to-download-while-using-cmake-for-ethminer).\
Once the modification of the Hunter `config.cmake` file is done, we generate the build configuration with 4 flags. `-DETHASHCL=OFF` **disable OpenCL**, since it is for AMD GPUs. However, ethminer can mine on both AMD and Nvidia GPUs at the same time. So if you want to mine Ethereum on such a hardware configuration, enable OpenCL with `-DETHASHCL=ON`. `-DAPICORE=ON` Enables the API (more details on that later). `-DETHASHCUDA=ON` makes sure **CUDA support is enabled**. And finally `-DBINKERN=OFF` prevent the installation of AMD binary kernels (once again, enable it if you want to use AMD GPUs).\
Once this is done, we build ethminer, then install it (so that it is in our `$PATH`). and finally **delete the repo directory** as we do not need any of these files anymore.\

Now we **expose port `3333`** (or any other port that you want to use, but make sure that this is the same port as the one in your `mining.sh` script) to access the API. The API is a **simple web page** with a few statistics such as the list of the GPUs, their temperature, fan speed and hash rate. This is helpful since we can **easily access all these informations** without having to look at the **docker logs**.
```Dockerfile
EXPOSE 3333
```
Example of the ethminer API :

<!-- {% include figure.html path="/assets/img/blog/ethminer_api_example.png" title="Example of ethminer API" alt=title class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" caption="Example of ethminer API dashboard." zoomable=true %} -->


We need to copy our mining script in the `/` directory of you docker image.
```Dockerfile
COPY mining.sh .
```

Finally, we have to **overrive** our base image entrypoint by adding a **new one**  which will **launch our mining script**!
```Dockerfile
ENTRYPOINT [ "bash", "mining.sh" ]
```

The final Dockerfile is named `Dockerfile` (no extension) and contains the following :
```Dockerfile
FROM nvidia/driver:460.73.01-ubuntu20.04

RUN apt-get update && \
    DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive apt-get install kmod git cmake perl gcc g++ wget --no-install-recommends -yq

RUN wget --no-check-certificate https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/11.4.2/local_installers/cuda_11.4.2_470.57.02_linux.run && \
    sh cuda_11.4.2_470.57.02_linux.run --silent --toolkit --no-man-page --no-opengl-libs && \
    rm cuda_11.4.2_470.57.02_linux.run 

WORKDIR "/"

RUN git clone https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer.git -o ethminer && \
    cd /ethminer && \
    git submodule update --init --recursive && \
    mkdir build && cd build && \
    sed -i '/hunter_config(Boost VERSION 1.66.0)/c\hunter_config(\n     Boost\n     VERSION 1.66.0_new_url\n     SHA1 f0b20d2d9f64041e8e7450600de0267244649766\n     URL https://boostorg.jfrog.io/artifactory/main/release/1.66.0/source/boost_1_66_0.tar.gz\ )' /ethminer/cmake/Hunter/config.cmake && \
    cmake .. -DETHASHCL=OFF -DAPICORE=ON -DETHASHCUDA=ON -DBINKERN=OFF && \
    cmake --build . && \
    make install && \
    cd / && rm -rf ethminer

EXPOSE 3333

COPY mining.sh .

ENTRYPOINT [ "bash", "mining.sh" ]
```

Your folder structure should now look like this:
```
ethminer-docker
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Dockerfile
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ mining.sh
```

## Building our Docker image

Once we have our Dockerfile, this is a rather **easy step**. Assuming that you are in a directory containing only your Dockerfile, run
```bash
docker build -t ethminer .
```
‚ö†Ô∏è _Do not forget the dot at the end of the command (it means "the current directory") !_

You can change `ethermine` by what you want. It is the **name of your docker image**. You can confirm your docker image is on your system by running `docker image ls`. This should give something like this :
```bash
REPOSITORY               TAG                     IMAGE ID       CREATED        SIZE
ethminer                 latest                  bcf676a57879   6 hours ago    7.15GB
```

## Running ethminer on docker <a name="running"></a>

Before running ethminer, you need to **install `nvidia-docker`**. This is a **wrapper** that allows docker to **access your GPUs** ! To install it, run :
```bash
sudo apt install nvidia-docker
```
Once this is done, you can run the container with :
```bash
docker run -p <port>:3333 -d -e MINING_ADDRESS=<your-mining-address> --name my_ethminer 
```
‚ö†Ô∏è _Replace_ `<port>` _by the port you want to use and_ `<your-mining-address>` _by the address of the pool, combined with your wallet. You can find more info about how to write the mining address [here](https://github.com/ethereum-mining/ethminer/blob/master/docs/POOL_EXAMPLES_ETH.md)_ 

The `-p <port>:3333` option allows to **acces the ethminer API** on port `<port>` of the machine you are currently running it on. If you are happy with port 3333, you can simply use `-p 3333` instead. `--name my_ethminer` gives a **friendly name** to your container. The `-d` makes the docker container run in **detached mode**. If you want to see the logs run :

```bash
docker logs -f my_ethminer
```

You should see logs like this :
```logs
ethminer 0.19.0

```

If it is the case, **congratulation**! You are now mining Ethereum on your computer thanks to Docker! There was no need to install `kmod`, `git`, `cmake`, `perl`, etc... or even the CUDA Toolkit. Everything was done while building the docker image!

If you want to stop the container, simply run `docker stop my_ethminer` and `docker start my_ethminer` to start it back.
